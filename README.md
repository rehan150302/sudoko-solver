I have designed a responsive Sudoku solver application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Empowers users with three essential options for Sudoku puzzle management:

1: "Solve": Instantly solves the Sudoku puzzle, providing users with a solution.
2: "Clear": Effortlessly clears the existing Sudoku puzzle, allowing for a fresh start.
3: "Load": Enables users to load an unsolved Sudoku puzzle, offering a variety of puzzles to tackle.
